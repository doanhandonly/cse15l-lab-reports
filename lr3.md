      When using grep -l, it finds any file path that matches the query, returning all paths that query. Grep -l is extremely useful if you want to find which files contains certain contents, you do not have to 
      open any files one by one, looking for something specific, simply use grep -l (query) and it will point you directly to which file path has what you are looking for.
